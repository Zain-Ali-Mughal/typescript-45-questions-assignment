/* Exercise 45: Cars: 
Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive 
a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

// Writing a function that stores a car info with optional parameters.
function carInfo(manufacturer, model, ...options) {
  //Now making car info object
  let car = {
    manufacturer: manufacturer,
    model: model,
  };
  //Now adding optional parameters to car object
  options.forEach((option) => {
    let [key, value] = option.split(":");
    car[key.trim()] = value.trim();
  });
  return car;
}
// Calling this function to create a car object.
let myCarInfo = carInfo("Toyota", "Grande", "Color: Black", "mileage: 1.8");

// Priniting the car information.
console.log(myCarInfo);
