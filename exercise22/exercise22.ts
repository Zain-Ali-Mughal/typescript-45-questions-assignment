/* Exercise 22: Intentional Error: 
If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. 
Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. 
Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

// Creating an Array
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Attempting to access an element beyond the array length
// This will cause an index error because the valid indices are 0 to 4

// console.log(numbers[5]);

// Now this created error "undefined". so now making this command "comment".

console.log(numbers[3]);
// as you can see now we used the index which is present in Array so it won't create an error.
